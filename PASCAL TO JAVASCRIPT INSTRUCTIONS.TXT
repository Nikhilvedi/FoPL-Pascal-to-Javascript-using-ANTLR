PASCAL TO JAVASCRIPT. 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING COMPILER - 

1. LOAD UP POWERSHELL
2. SET THE HOME DIRECTORY TO THE FOLDER WHERE YOU'VE PLACED THE FILES
3. UPDATE THE JAVA,JAVAC, AND ANTLR FILES SO THEY HAVE THE JDK WHICH IS ON THE SYSTEM YOU'RE USING.
4. USE - JAVAC.BAT PASCAL/*.JAVA - TO RECOMPILE THE FILES TO THE LATEST VERSIONS 
4.5 (YOU MAY HAVE TO RECOMPILE ALL TOGETHER, USING ANTLR) - INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED BELLOW
5. USE  - ..\JAVA.BAT PASCAL.PASCAL SAMPLE1.PASCAL > SAMPLE1.JS - TO CONVERT THE FIRST FILE TO JAVASCRIPT. CHECK THE FILE.
6. IF THE FILE CONVERTED SUCCESSFULLY DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHER TWO FILES. 
7. COMPILING COMPLETED.


4.5.1 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING ANTLR TO RECOMPILE FILES..
4.5.2 LOCATE THE FILES PASCAL.JAVA AND PASCALlISTENERIMPL.JAVA - MAKE A COPY IN A DIRECTORY CALLED PASCAL
4.5.3 TYPE - ..\antlr.bat −no−visitor -Listener −o pascal −package Pascal Pascal.g4
4.5.4 USE ..\javac.bat pascal\*.java
4.5.5 CONTINUE ABOVE.

RUNNING THE FILE IN MOZILLASHELLjs
Change Directory to the location of the MozillaShelljS
Run .\MozillaShellJs where MozillaShellJs is the .exe's name 
You should now have the powershell pointer as 'js>'
Navigate to the files

OPTION 1 - 
Run ..\sample1.js (for example)
Do the same with the other files. 

OPTION 2 - 
Write the program into the js> pointer (copy it out)

Option 3 - 
Double click on the js.exe which should bring up a command prompt window. Enter the code manually into the Command Box or find the file and run it. 

CONTINUED INSTRUCTIONS - 

PARSE TREES -
PRINTING THE PARSE TREE -

Veiwing the parse tree is possible in a jframe (swing) which appears when running the file using java.bat as explained above. 
I have also saved the trees in a .png file with their respective names and the identifier _tree
The code for this is in the pascal.java file. 
(- Comment the jframe lines if you'd like to stop them outputting.) 

THE PARSE TREE CAN BE PRINTED AS A STRING, GO TO PASCAL.JAVA AND UNCOMMENT THE LINE   
"System.out.println(tree.toStringTree(parser));"
Run ..\javac.bat pascal\*.java
RUN ..\java.bat pascal.pascal sample1.pascal > sample1.js AND SEE THE STRING FORM OF THE TREE PRESENTED IN THE FILE (at the end).


SAMPLE2.PASCAL - PROBLEM 

I did some research into pascal and found that sample2 is invalid even after the correction sent out in an email, as far as i can tell from the grammar and looking online the file cant have a PROCEDURE statement following a BEGIN as the grammar interprets the PROCEDURE as a statement.
Therefore sample2 is missing a closing brace at the end of the file, i've worked arround it and made as much work as possible. 

The sample2_tree.png file shows the Parse tree mis-enterpreting the PROCEDURE as a STATEMENT.
Whereas in savings_tree the parser finds the correct part of the grammar each time. 

I also tried to add a rule in the grammar to fix this, but it broke further so removed it.
